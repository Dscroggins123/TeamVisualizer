# TemplateEngine

## Description
```
The purpose of this project was to create a line of code that took in custom company information from the user and created a team from those inputs.  I used a a combination of different classes to achieve my final desired product. In my final product the user can run the node function in their terminal to create a visual of their team.

## Challenges
```
The challenges I had with this assignment were keeping track of the many variables and function so I could reuse them. I found myself forgetting the path to certain variables which made it quite hard to get the desired information up on the screen

```
## Installation
```
To install my app you will need to download node, terminal and also npm packages.
